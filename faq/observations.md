## How to manually open the dome?

There are few steps to perform. First, we need to Take Over control and go to Manual mode. Then, we need to specify time periods in which the dome can be manually opened (i.e. next hour), and finally, we need to extend activation time (i.e. 15 minutes). This process is lengthy on purpose. Opening the dome is the most dangerous command, and the observer should be aware of eventual consquences.

This means, that the dome is closed, and therefore we cannot observe. However, once the dome will be opened, the observations can be performed.
